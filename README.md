# CellularAutomataPRNG

This repository contains the CPU and GPU implementation of a Cellular Automaton based Pseudo-Random Number Generator.

## Instructions
To use the generator you need to include the header file in your working directory.

## Pre-requisites:
1) C++11 or above:
  CPU implementation of the PRNG uses the C++11 thread function to support multiplatform threading and parallelization.
2) NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit:
  GPU implementation of the PRNG uses CUDA to support parallel generation of random numbers on GPU.
3) NVIDIA GPU and Drivers:
  NVIDIA GPU and drivers are required to run CUDA based files.
